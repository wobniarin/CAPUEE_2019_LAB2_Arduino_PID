# CAPUEE_2019_LAB2_Arduino_PID
This repository contains all the needed material to develop the second laboratory session on the course "Control and Automation for the Efficient Use of Energy"

In this laboratory session we will control some LEDs using the PID Library for Arduino. 

In this repository you will find two .ino files with the code with some gaps, and also a .pdf file with all the information you need for this session.

Enjoy! :)
